Simple code to use a key to "encode" a string taught to Scouts in the US

First implementation uses fixed key

Second implementation takes key parameter

Third implementation takes messages and encoded messages and works out the key


These katas are fun but they assume inputs are valid so I've added some extra validation

They don't deal with 2 char characters and assume we're in the 16bit unicode values
